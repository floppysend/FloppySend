### FloppySend Integrating with SMPP


Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMPP) is an industry-standard protocol for exchanging short messages and data between systems.

SMPP defines operation and protocol data units (PDUs), where every operation has a request PDU and an associated response PDU. The only exception is for alert notifications, which do not require an associated response PDU. The receiving entity must send the associated response to the SMPP PDU request.

FloppySend supports version 3.4 of the SMPP protocol, [Read more...](https://floppysend.com/apiReferences#SMPP)
